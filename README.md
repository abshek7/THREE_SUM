<p id="description">This project is a basic audio visualization system implemented using Three.js a JavaScript library for creating and animating 3D graphics in a web browser. The goal of this project is to visualize audio data in real-time creating an engaging and dynamic visual representation of the sound being played. The visualization consists of a grid and a ball rendered in a 3D scene. The grid serves as a ground plane while the ball represents a dynamic element that responds to the audio input. As the audio plays the ball's position and shape are modulated based on the frequency and intensity of the sound.</p>
